# ring-catcher
A generic, template C++ class that allows for storing an however complex structure of data at the effort of just a couple rows of code.

Its original intent is to save samples of time series at runtime so as to perform later analysis (post-mortem, performance optimization, debug etc.) without the struggles of little detail management and manually handling loads of data.
